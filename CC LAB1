## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To replicate this setup, you will need the following software:

1.  **VMware Workstation Pro 17**.
2.  [cite_start]**Ubuntu Server ISO Image:** The specific file used was an ISO for **Ubuntu 64-bit Server 24.04.3**[cite: 53].

## 🚀 Installation & Setup Guide

[cite_start]The VM was created using the **Typical (recommended)** configuration [cite: 34] [cite_start]for a Workstation 17.5 or later virtual machine[cite: 35].

### 1. Create a New Virtual Machine

* [cite_start]**Configuration Type:** **Typical (recommended)** was selected in the New Virtual Machine Wizard[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Installer:** The installation was started by selecting the **Installer disc image file (iso)** option [cite: 51] [cite_start]and pointing to the Ubuntu ISO file (`C:\Users\aimen\Downloads\ubuntu-24.04.3-live-serve`)[cite: 52].
    * [cite_start]The wizard automatically detected the OS as **Ubuntu 64-bit Server 24.04.3**[cite: 53].
* [cite_start]**VM Name:** The virtual machine was named **Ubuntu 64-bit (2)**[cite: 67, 100].
* [cite_start]**Disk Capacity:** The maximum disk size was set to **20 GB** [cite: 83, 106][cite_start], which is the recommended size for Ubuntu 64-bit[cite: 84]. [cite_start]The disk was configured to **Split virtual disk into multiple files**[cite: 87].
* **Final Hardware Settings:**
    * [cite_start]**Version:** Workstation 17.5 or later [cite: 103]
    * [cite_start]**Operating System:** Ubuntu 64-bit [cite: 104]
    * [cite_start]**Memory:** 4096 MB [cite: 108]
    * [cite_start]**Network Adapter:** NAT [cite: 110]
    * [cite_start]**Other Devices:** 2 CPU cores, CD/DVD, USB Controller, Sound Card [cite: 112]

### 2. Ubuntu Server Installation

* [cite_start]**Installation Base:** The base installation chosen was the standard **Ubuntu Server**[cite: 191].
* [cite_start]**User Credentials:** The username used to log in after installation was **`aimen`**[cite: 232, 261].
